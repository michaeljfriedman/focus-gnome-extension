# Focus

Focus is an extension for Gnome 3.18+ that mutes the color on your desktop,
allowing you to focus better. You'd be surprised how much the amount of color
on your desktop can distract you, or suck you into your screen for hours on end!

This is a fork of the extension Desaturate All by Nicolas Brack.

## Installation

To install:

- Copy this folder to the Gnome extension folder: `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions`.
- Restart Gnome with `ALT`+`F2`, then enter `r` and press Enter.
- Enable the extension with Gnome Tweak Tool.

## Usage

This extension just has an icon that appears in the top bar. You can click it
to cycle through different levels of color muting. It ranges from the default
full color all the way to grayscale (no color).
